        <h2 class="section-title">Complete Guide to Setting Freelance Rates</h2>
        
        <h3>Why Proper Rate Calculation Matters</h3>
        <p>Setting the right freelance rate is crucial for sustainable business. Charge too little and you'll struggle financially; charge too much and you may lose clients. This calculator helps find the balance by considering all necessary factors including desired income, working hours, expenses, and non-billable time.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Billable vs Non-Billable Time</h3>
        <p>Freelancers typically only bill 60-80% of their working time. The rest goes to:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Marketing and client acquisition</li>
          <li>Administrative tasks and bookkeeping</li>
          <li>Professional development and learning</li>
          <li>Proposals and estimates</li>
          <li>Communication and email management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Business Expenses for Freelancers</h3>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Software & Tools:</strong> $1,000-$5,000/year (subscriptions, licenses)</li>
          <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> $500-$2,000/year (computer, monitors, peripherals)</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> $500-$2,000/year (health, liability, equipment)</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> $1,000-$5,000/year (website, ads, networking)</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Services:</strong> $1,000-$3,000/year (accountant, lawyer)</li>
          <li><strong>Office/Workspace:</strong> $0-$10,000/year (coworking, home office)</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> $500-$3,000/year (courses, conferences, books)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hourly Rate vs Salary Conversion</h3>
        <p>Converting between hourly and salary rates requires accounting for benefits employees receive that freelancers must cover themselves:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Health insurance</li>
          <li>Retirement contributions</li>
          <li>Paid time off</li>
          <li>Sick leave</li>
          <li>Equipment and tools</li>
          <li>Professional development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, freelance hourly rates should be 1.5-2x the equivalent employee hourly rate to account for these factors.</p>

        <h3>Setting Rates by Experience Level</h3>
        
        <h4>Entry Level (0-2 years)</h4>
        <p><strong>Typical Range:</strong> $25-$50/hour<br>
        Focus on building portfolio and gaining experience. Competitive pricing helps land initial clients.</p>

        <h4>Intermediate (2-5 years)</h4>
        <p><strong>Typical Range:</strong> $50-$100/hour<br>
        Established skills and proven track record justify mid-tier rates. Can specialize in specific niches.</p>

        <h4>Senior (5-10 years)</h4>
        <p><strong>Typical Range:</strong> $100-$200/hour<br>
        Deep expertise and strong portfolio command premium rates. Often focus on strategic work.</p>

        <h4>Expert (10+ years)</h4>
        <p><strong>Typical Range:</strong> $200+/hour<br>
        Industry authority status, high-value deliverables, and established reputation support top-tier pricing.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Pricing Models</h3>
        
        <h4>Project-Based Pricing</h4>
        <p>Charge per project rather than hourly. Benefits: Incentivizes efficiency, easier for clients to budget. Calculate by estimating hours needed and multiplying by your hourly rate, then add 20-30% buffer.</p>

        <h4>Retainer Agreements</h4>
        <p>Monthly fee for ongoing availability and services. Provides stable income and client gets priority access. Typically 10-20% discount vs hourly for guaranteed monthly income.</p>

        <h4>Value-Based Pricing</h4>
        <p>Price based on value delivered to client rather than time spent. Highest earning potential but requires strong positioning and proven ROI track record.</p>

        <h3>Strategies to Increase Your Rates</h3>
        <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Specialize:</strong> Niche expertise commands premium rates</li>
          <li><strong>Build Portfolio:</strong> Showcase successful projects and results</li>
          <li><strong>Get Testimonials:</strong> Social proof justifies higher rates</li>
          <li><strong>Improve Skills:</strong> Continuous learning adds value</li>
          <li><strong>Target Better Clients:</strong> Enterprise clients pay more than startups</li>
          <li><strong>Package Services:</strong> Bundle offerings for higher perceived value</li>
          <li><strong>Raise Gradually:</strong> Increase 10-20% annually for existing clients</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate Value:</strong> Clearly articulate ROI you provide</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When to Say No to Low-Paying Work</h3>
        <p>Taking every project, regardless of pay, can trap you in a cycle of underearning. Red flags to decline:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Clients who negotiate aggressively on rates</li>
          <li>Projects requiring more hours than budget allows</li>
          <li>Scope creep without additional compensation</li>
          <li>Clients with unrealistic expectations</li>
          <li>Work that doesn't align with your expertise or portfolio goals</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How do I calculate my hourly rate as a freelancer?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Divide your desired annual income (plus expenses) by billable hours per year. For example: $80,000 income + $10,000 expenses = $90,000 ÷ 1,920 billable hours (40 hours/week × 48 weeks) = $46.88/hour minimum rate.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What should my freelance rate be compared to salary?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Your freelance hourly rate should typically be 1.5-2x the equivalent employee hourly rate. If an employee makes $50,000/year ($24/hour), your freelance rate should be $36-$48/hour to account for benefits, taxes, and business expenses.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How many billable weeks should I plan for?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Most freelancers use 48 weeks (accounting for 4 weeks vacation/holidays) or 46 weeks (6 weeks off plus sick days). Never assume all 52 weeks are billable - you need time for business development, admin work, and breaks.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Should I include taxes in my rate calculation?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Yes, as a freelancer you pay both employer and employee portions of payroll taxes (roughly 15.3% self-employment tax) plus income tax. Build tax obligations into your desired annual income to ensure you can cover them.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Is it better to charge hourly or per project?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Both have merits. Hourly protects against scope creep and fairly compensates your time. Project-based rewards efficiency and is easier for clients to approve. Many freelancers use hybrid: hourly for ongoing work, project-based for defined deliverables.</div>
