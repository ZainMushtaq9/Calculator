        <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Loan Eligibility</h2>
        
        <h3>What is Loan Eligibility?</h3>
        <p>
          Loan eligibility refers to the maximum loan amount a lender is willing to offer you based on your 
          income, existing financial obligations, credit history, and other factors. Understanding your eligibility 
          helps you plan your home purchase or loan requirements realistically and avoid loan rejection.
        </p>

        <h3>How is Loan Eligibility Calculated?</h3>
        <p>
          Lenders use the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR) method to determine eligibility. The FOIR 
          represents the maximum percentage of your income that can go toward loan repayments. Most lenders 
          use a FOIR of 40-50%.
        </p>
        <p>The calculation follows these steps:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Calculate available income after existing obligations</li>
          <li>Apply FOIR to determine maximum allowable EMI</li>
          <li>Use EMI formula in reverse to calculate maximum eligible loan amount</li>
          <li>Consider additional factors like credit score and property value</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Factors Affecting Your Home Loan Eligibility</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Monthly Income</h4>
        <p>
          Your gross monthly income is the primary factor. Higher income directly translates to higher eligibility. 
          Salaried individuals should include basic salary, allowances, and bonuses. Self-employed individuals 
          should consider average monthly income from business or profession.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Existing Financial Obligations</h4>
        <p>
          All existing loan EMIs, credit card payments, and other financial commitments reduce your available 
          income for new loans. Clearing or reducing existing loans before applying can significantly improve 
          your eligibility.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Interest Rate</h4>
        <p>
          Lower interest rates allow for higher loan eligibility since the EMI for the same principal amount 
          would be lower. Shop around for the best rates from different lenders to maximize your eligibility.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Loan Tenure</h4>
        <p>
          Longer tenure reduces monthly EMI, thereby increasing eligibility. However, longer tenure also means 
          paying more total interest over the loan period. Balance between comfortable EMI and reasonable tenure.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Credit Score</h4>
        <p>
          While not directly calculated in this tool, your credit score significantly impacts eligibility. 
          Scores above 750 are considered excellent and may qualify for better rates and higher loan amounts. 
          Maintain good credit habits to improve your score.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Age</h4>
        <p>
          Younger borrowers typically get longer loan tenures since they have more working years ahead. 
          Most lenders require loan closure by retirement age (typically 60-65 years), which affects both 
          tenure and eligibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Loans You Can Check Eligibility For</h3>
        
        <h4>Home Loan Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          Home loans or mortgages are secured loans for purchasing residential property. Eligibility depends 
          on income, property value, location, and down payment capability. Most lenders finance 75-90% of 
          property value, requiring 10-25% down payment.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal Loan Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          Personal loans are unsecured and have stricter eligibility criteria. Lenders carefully evaluate 
          income stability, existing obligations, and credit history. Personal loan amounts are typically 
          10-20 times your monthly salary, subject to FOIR limits.
        </p>

        <h4>Gold Loan Eligibility</h4>
        <p>
          Gold loans are secured by gold ornaments or coins. Eligibility primarily depends on gold purity 
          and weight. Lenders typically offer 75-90% of gold value as loan amount. Interest rates are 
          generally lower than personal loans due to collateral security.
        </p>

        <h3>Tips to Improve Your Loan Eligibility</h3>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Add Co-Applicant:</strong> Include spouse or family member's income to boost eligibility</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Existing Debts:</strong> Pay off or prepay existing loans to free up income</li>
          <li><strong>Increase Income Sources:</strong> Show rental income, freelance earnings, or investments</li>
          <li><strong>Opt for Longer Tenure:</strong> Extend loan period to reduce EMI and increase eligibility</li>
          <li><strong>Improve Credit Score:</strong> Pay bills on time, reduce credit utilization, fix errors</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce Credit Card Debt:</strong> Lower credit card balances significantly</li>
          <li><strong>Choose Lower Interest Rate:</strong> Negotiate or compare lenders for best rates</li>
          <li><strong>Increase Down Payment:</strong> Higher down payment means lower loan requirement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Not disclosing all existing loans and obligations</li>
          <li>Applying to multiple lenders simultaneously (hurts credit score)</li>
          <li>Overestimating income or underestimating expenses</li>
          <li>Ignoring credit report errors before applying</li>
          <li>Taking maximum eligible amount without considering future needs</li>
          <li>Not accounting for processing fees and other charges</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Documents Required for Loan Application</h3>
        <p>
          While eligibility calculation is the first step, actual loan approval requires comprehensive documentation:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Identity Proof: Passport, Driver's License, or Government ID</li>
          <li>Address Proof: Utility bills, rental agreement, or property documents</li>
          <li>Income Proof: Salary slips (last 3-6 months), bank statements, tax returns</li>
          <li>Employment Proof: Employment letter, offer letter, or business registration</li>
          <li>Property Documents: Sale agreement, property papers (for home loans)</li>
          <li>Credit Report: Some lenders may request your credit report</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What is FOIR and how does it affect my loan eligibility?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) is the percentage of your income that lenders allow for 
            loan repayment. Typically 40-50%, it means if your income is $5,000 and FOIR is 50%, maximum 
            $2,500 can go toward all loan EMIs. Higher FOIR increases eligibility but also increases financial strain.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How does adding a co-applicant improve loan eligibility?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Adding a co-applicant (spouse, parent, or sibling) combines both incomes for eligibility calculation. 
            If you earn $4,000 and your spouse earns $3,000, your combined income of $7,000 is considered, 
            significantly increasing the eligible loan amount. Both applicants' credit scores are evaluated.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What is the minimum credit score required for home loans?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 650-700 for home loan approval. Scores above 750 
            are considered excellent and may qualify for better interest rates and higher loan amounts. 
            Lower scores may result in loan rejection or higher interest rates.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Can I get a loan if I have existing EMIs?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes, but existing EMIs reduce your available income for new loans. Lenders calculate your net 
            disposable income after deducting existing obligations. Consider prepaying or closing existing 
            loans to improve eligibility, or add a co-applicant to increase income.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
