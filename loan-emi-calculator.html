      <h2 class="section-title">Complete Guide to EMI Calculation in Pakistan</h2>
      
      <h3>What is EMI?</h3>
      <p>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is a fixed payment amount that borrowers pay to lenders every month on a specified date. In Pakistan, EMI is commonly used for home loans, car loans, and personal loans. The EMI comprises both the principal amount and the interest charged on the loan.</p>

      <h3>Types of Loans in Pakistan</h3>
      
      <h4>Home Loan EMI Calculator</h4>
      <p>Calculate your monthly payments for home mortgages in Pakistan. Banks like HBL, UBL, MCB, and Meezan Bank offer home loans with competitive interest rates typically ranging from 12% to 18% annually. Home loans in Pakistan usually have tenures of 10-20 years.</p>

      <h4>Car Loan EMI Calculator</h4>
      <p>Planning to buy a car in Pakistan? Use this EMI calculator to estimate your monthly car loan payments. Car loans typically have shorter tenures (3-7 years) with interest rates between 15-20%. Popular banks offering car loans include Bank Alfalah, Allied Bank, and Askari Bank.</p>

      <h4>Personal Loan EMI Calculator</h4>
      <p>Personal loans in Pakistan are unsecured loans with higher interest rates (18-25% annually) and shorter tenures (1-5 years). Calculate your personal loan EMI to understand the total cost of borrowing for weddings, education, medical emergencies, or business needs.</p>

      <h3>EMI Formula</h3>
      <p style="background: var(--gray-100); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; font-family: monospace;">
        EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N-1]
      </p>
      <p>Where: P = Principal (loan amount in PKR), R = Monthly interest rate, N = Loan tenure in months</p>

      <h3>Interest Rates in Pakistan (2026)</h3>
