        <h2 class="section-title">Complete Guide to YouTube Earnings</h2>
        
        <h3>How Does YouTube Pay Creators?</h3>
        <p>
          YouTube pays creators through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which allows eligible channels to 
          earn money from ads displayed on their videos. Revenue comes primarily from advertisements, but creators 
          can also earn from channel memberships, Super Chat, YouTube Premium revenue, and merchandise.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding CPM and RPM</h3>
        
        <h4>What is CPM?</h4>
        <p>
          CPM (Cost Per Mille) is the amount advertisers pay per 1,000 ad impressions. This varies widely based 
          on factors like audience location, video content, advertiser demand, and season. CPM rates typically 
          range from $1 to $30, with most channels averaging $2-$10.
        </p>

        <h4>What is RPM?</h4>
        <p>
          RPM (Revenue Per Mille) is what creators actually earn per 1,000 views after YouTube takes its cut. 
          YouTube keeps approximately 45% of ad revenue, so if CPM is $10, your RPM would be around $5.50. 
          Our calculator uses realistic RPM estimates for accuracy.
        </p>

        <h3>Factors Affecting YouTube Earnings</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Audience Location</h4>
        <p>
          Viewers from countries like United States, Canada, UK, and Australia generate higher CPM rates 
          ($5-$20) compared to developing countries ($0.50-$3). This is because advertisers pay more to 
          reach audiences with higher purchasing power.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Content Niche</h4>
        <p>
          Different niches have vastly different earning potential:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>High CPM ($10-$30):</strong> Finance, Business, Real Estate, Legal, Insurance</li>
          <li><strong>Medium CPM ($5-$10):</strong> Technology, Education, Health, Travel</li>
          <li><strong>Low CPM ($1-$5):</strong> Gaming, Vlogs, Music, Entertainment, Kids Content</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Audience Demographics</h4>
        <p>
          Age, gender, and interests of your viewers significantly impact earnings. Advertisers pay premium 
          rates for audiences aged 25-54 with higher incomes and specific interests that match their products.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Video Length and Ad Placement</h4>
        <p>
          Videos longer than 8 minutes can include mid-roll ads, significantly increasing earning potential. 
          More ad placements mean more opportunities for revenue, but too many ads may hurt viewer retention.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Seasonal Trends</h4>
        <p>
          YouTube earnings fluctuate throughout the year. December typically has highest CPM rates due to 
          holiday shopping season. January-February often sees lower rates as advertiser budgets reset.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Engagement Metrics</h4>
        <p>
          Watch time, click-through rate (CTR), and audience retention affect ad revenue. Videos that keep 
          viewers engaged longer and have higher CTR on ads generate more revenue per view.
        </p>

        <h3>YouTube Partner Program Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          To monetize your YouTube channel, you must meet these minimum requirements:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--gray-700); line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>1,000 subscribers</li>
          <li>4,000 valid watch hours in the past 12 months (or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days)</li>
          <li>Comply with YouTube monetization policies</li>
          <li>Live in a country where YPP is available</li>
          <li>Have an AdSense account linked to your channel</li>
          <li>Enable 2-step verification on your Google account</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Revenue Streams on YouTube</h3>
        
        <h4>Channel Memberships</h4>
        <p>
          Viewers can pay monthly fees ($0.99-$49.99) for exclusive perks like badges, emojis, and members-only 
          content. Available to channels with 30,000+ subscribers (or 1,000+ for gaming channels).
        </p>

        <h4>Super Chat and Super Stickers</h4>
        <p>
          During live streams and premieres, viewers can purchase highlighted messages to stand out in the chat. 
          Prices range from $1 to $500 per Super Chat.
        </p>

        <h4>YouTube Premium Revenue</h4>
        <p>
          Earn a share of subscription fees from YouTube Premium members who watch your content. Revenue is 
          based on watch time from Premium members.
        </p>

        <h4>Merchandise Shelf</h4>
        <p>
          Eligible channels can showcase official merchandise directly below videos, earning commission on sales.
        </p>

        <h4>Affiliate Marketing</h4>
        <p>
          Promote products in video descriptions and earn commissions on sales through affiliate links. This 
          is not YouTube revenue but can significantly supplement ad income.
        </p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            YouTube pays creators monthly once you reach the $100 threshold in your AdSense account. Payments
